# Lean-Optimization-at-Evercharge
Lean Optimization at Evercharge | Lean 6 Sigma, Value Stream Mapping, Supply Chain: 
**A Real-World Manufacturing Optimization Project Using Lean Six Sigma, Value Stream Mapping, and Behavioral Incentivization**

---

##  Overview

This repository documents the end-to-end Lean Optimization engagement conducted in collaboration with **EverCharge**, a Palo Alto-based electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure startup (now acquired by SK Group). As part of a cross-functional consulting team, we partnered with engineers and operations managers at EverCharge to identify production inefficiencies in their EV charger assembly line and implement a lean manufacturing transformation.

Our goal was to **increase assembly efficiency**, **reduce deployment time**, and **create a scalable manufacturing model** that could support EverCharge‚Äôs growing demand in the autonomous and commercial fleet space.

##  About EverCharge

- **Founded**: 2013 | **HQ**: Palo Alto, CA  
- **Acquired**: By SK Group in 2022  
- **Core Product**: SmartPower‚Ñ¢ Charging Stations (residential, commercial, fleet-scale)  
- **Problem**: Assembly line efficiency stagnated at ~65%, with average build time of **25 minutes per unit** vs. the target of **17 minutes**. High employee turnover, morale issues, and lack of data-driven feedback loops contributed to systemic inefficiencies.

| üìà Improve Line Efficiency | Raise production line efficiency from 65% by at least 5‚Äì10% within 3 months |
| üë• Boost Morale & Engagement | Address micro-downtimes and high turnover by motivating technicians |
| üìä Enable Real-Time Metrics | Install visual displays for Takt time and daily KPI tracking |
| üîÅ Create Sustainable Impact | Implement lean principles and continuous improvement loop |

##  Methodology

###  Tools & Frameworks Used
- **Lean Six Sigma DMAIC Framework**
- **Value Stream Mapping (VSM)**
- **Kaizen (Continuous Improvement)**
- **Just-In-Time (JIT) Production**
- **Takt Time Analysis**
- **A3 Problem Solving**
- **RACI Matrix and Gantt Scheduling**

###  Phase Breakdown

#### 1. **Define**
- Collaborated with EverCharge's factory manager to understand the production workflow and pain points.
- Identified Station 6 as the primary bottleneck due to a single testing fixture.
- Conducted floor observations and time-studies to define scope and map flow.

#### 2. **Measure**
- Measured Takt time across 7 technicians on the 48A EV002 Pedestal Line.
- Discovered consistent inefficiencies, idle time due to tester availability, and non-uniform work distribution.
- Quantified morale issues via break frequency and anecdotal feedback.

#### 3. **Analyze**
- Used a **Process Area Layout** and VSM to map current and proposed workflows.
- Identified non-value-adding activities, untracked delays, and feedback gaps.
- Determined real-time visibility and incentive structure as primary levers for change.

#### 4. **Improve**
- **Installed Real-Time KPI Dashboards** to display current output vs. Takt time at each workstation.
- **Launched Output-Based Pay Pilot**:
  - Weekly target: 160 units
  - Full compensation if output met, regardless of hours worked
  - Maintained quality control standards
- **Deployed Recognition Programs**:
  - Non-monetary: shout-outs, team lunches
  - Monetary: bonuses tied to sustained efficiency improvements

#### 5. **Control**
- Scheduled continuous monitoring and feedback check-ins with the EverCharge factory team.
- Designed a self-sustaining loop with quarterly reviews and scope for incremental increases in production targets.
- Proposed scaling the model across other production lines after successful pilot phase.

##  Impact

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Assembly Time | 25 mins/unit | ~18.5 mins/unit | **‚Üì 25%** |
| Utilization Rate | 65% | ~80% (pilot) | **‚Üë 15%** |
| Weekly Output | 160 units | 170‚Äì180 units | **‚Üë 6‚Äì12%** |
| Morale Indicators | High turnover, micro-downtime | Increased engagement | **Qualitative improvement** |
| Projected Cost Savings | ‚Äî | $2,700/month (utilities), 30‚Äì40% output gain | **Significant** |

##  My Role (Naveen Murali)

- Led Lean Six Sigma implementation and Takt time analytics
- Owned Value Stream Mapping and floor layout redesign strategy
- Facilitated interviews with factory managers and technicians
- Designed incentive frameworks and monitored pilot rollout success
- Delivered stakeholder presentations and final documentation

---

##  Future Recommendations

- Scale the lean system to other product lines and shifts
- Implement a second tester at Station 6 to eliminate single-point bottleneck
- Continue tracking technician output and gradually elevate output targets
- Consider integration with IoT-based dashboards for deeper analytics

##  Why It Matters

As EV adoption grows, manufacturing scalability is not just a cost issue‚Äîit‚Äôs a **climate issue**. This project proves how lean operations, when coupled with data visibility and worker motivation, can **meaningfully scale green infrastructure**. It‚Äôs not just about efficiency; it‚Äôs about sustainability, trust, and speed to market.
